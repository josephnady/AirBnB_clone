`the contents of that project are:`

* BaseModel - to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) all classes in the project inherit from BaseModel
* the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
